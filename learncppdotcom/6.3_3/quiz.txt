Modify the following program so that instead of having maxScore hold the
largest score directly, a variable named maxIndex holds the index of the
largest score.

    #include <iostream>
    
    int main()
    {
        int scores[] = { 84, 92, 76, 81, 56 };
        const int numStudents = sizeof(scores) / sizeof(scores[0]);
    
        int maxScore = 0; // keep track of our largest score
    
        // now look for a larger score
        for (int student = 0; student < numStudents; ++student)
            if (scores[student] > maxScore)
                maxScore = scores[student];
    
        std::cout << "The best score was " << maxScore << '\n';
    
        return 0;
    }
