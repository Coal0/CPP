In the chapter 2 comprehensive quiz, we wrote a program to simulate a ball
falling off of a tower. Because we didnâ€™t have loops yet, the ball could only
fall for 5 seconds.

Take the program below and modify it so that the ball falls for as many
seconds as needed until it reaches the ground.

In constants.h:

    #ifndef CONSTANTS_H
    #define CONSTANTS_H
    
    namespace myConstants
    {
        const double gravity(9.8); // in meters/second squared
    }
    #endif

In your main code file:

    #include <iostream>
    #include "constants.h"
    
    // gets initial height from user and returns it
    double getInitialHeight()
    {
        std::cout << "Enter the height of the tower in meters: ";
        double initialHeight;
        std::cin >> initialHeight;
        return initialHeight;
    }
    
    // Returns height from ground after "secondsPassed" seconds
    double calculateHeight(double initialHeight, int secondsPassed)
    {
        // Using formula: [ s = u * t + (a * t^2) / 2 ], here u(initial velocity) = 0
        double distanceFallen = (myConstants::gravity * secondsPassed * secondsPassed) / 2;
        double currentHeight = initialHeight - distanceFallen;
    
        return currentHeight;
    }
    
    // Prints height every second till ball has reached the ground
    void printHeight(double height, int secondsPassed)
    {
        if (height > 0.0)
        {
            std::cout << "At " << secondsPassed << " seconds, the ball is at height:\t" << height <<
                " meters\n";
        }
        else
            std::cout << "At " << secondsPassed << " seconds, the ball is on the ground.\n";
    }
    
    void calculateAndPrintHeight(double initialHeight, int secondsPassed)
    {
        double height = calculateHeight(initialHeight, secondsPassed);
        printHeight(height, secondsPassed);
    }
    
    int main()
    {
        const double initialHeight = getInitialHeight();
    
        calculateAndPrintHeight(initialHeight, 0);
        calculateAndPrintHeight(initialHeight, 1);
        calculateAndPrintHeight(initialHeight, 2);
        calculateAndPrintHeight(initialHeight, 3);
        calculateAndPrintHeight(initialHeight, 4);
        calculateAndPrintHeight(initialHeight, 5);
    
        return 0;
    }
